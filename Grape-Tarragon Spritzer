Tarragon Syrup
1 cup raw sugar
¼ cup (packed) finely chopped tarragon

Spritzer
1½ lb. seedless red grapes, preferably organic
3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
4 cups sparkling water, chilled until almost frozen
Tarragon sprigs (for serving)

Preparation
Tarragon Syrup
Step 1
Heat raw sugar, tarragon, and ½ cup water in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring, until mixture is hot to the touch and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into an airtight container or small bowl. Cover and chill until cold, at least 30 minutes.
