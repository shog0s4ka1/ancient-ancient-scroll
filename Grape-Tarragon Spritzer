Ingredients
Tarragon Syrup
1 cup raw sugar
¼ cup (packed) finely chopped tarragon

Spritzer
1½ lb. seedless red grapes, preferably organic
3 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice
4 cups sparkling water, chilled until almost frozen
Tarragon sprigs (for serving)

Preparation
Tarragon Syrup
Step 1
Heat raw sugar, tarragon, and ½ cup water in a small saucepan over low heat, stirring, until mixture is hot to the touch and sugar is dissolved, about 3 minutes. Let cool, then strain through a fine-mesh sieve into an airtight container or small bowl. Cover and chill until cold, at least 30 minutes.

SPRITZER
Step 2
Freeze one third of grapes on a large plate until frozen solid, about 3 hours.

Step 3
Purée remaining grapes in a blender until mostly smooth. Strain through fine-mesh sieve into a pitcher, pressing on solids to release as much juice as possible; discard solids. (You should have about 1¼ cups juice.)

Step 4
Stir in lemon juice and ¼ cup tarragon syrup. Pour in sparkling water and stir gently to combine. Taste and add more syrup if needed to sweeten further.

Step 5
To serve, place a handful of frozen grapes in each glass, pour in spritzer, and garnish each with a tarragon sprig.
